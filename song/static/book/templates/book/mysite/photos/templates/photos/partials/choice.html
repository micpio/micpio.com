<p>In our brave new world communication is our number one priority. Woops I forgot my I Phone on the kitchen table..wait that wont happen I've had it surgically implanted under my skin on my left arm sure it hurt at first and somewhat when I take a shower but so worth it. I made the choice to have the surgery and while my doctor advised against it local state and federal law was on my side. with the appointment of Kavanagh who knows how long that will last. Any way this is how the new I Phone 27.786 works: you simply say or think &quot;computer&quot; nice retro touch don't you agree? and the device takes you to safari (the internet) and all your questions will be answered in the order they are received hell you can even make a phone call with the dammed thing. The reason I mention this is that now you don't have to say a word to communicate you never did in the first place but &quot;who knew&quot; a simple hand jester or repulse motion like when &quot;Creepy Joe&quot; tries to smell your hair and &quot;presto&quot; your communicating. This is very important because it lets all people make choices even those in the early stage of life an embryo can simply jester NO! by moving away from the prodding of a mini vacuum nozzle. So in conclusion I can state that I am unequivocally 100% pro choice but choice by the one who has the most to loose. &quot;Sorry my arm is throbbing I have to take this call.&quot;</p>
