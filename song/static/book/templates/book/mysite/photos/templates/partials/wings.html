<p>How did these chicken wars start anyway. I prefer buffalo wings my self but I keep seeing stories about the extreme right and extreme left wing faction of our political parties even the Buffalo's get caught up in this bazaar ping pong game.&quot;Brietbart an extreme right news aggregator&quot; says the Huff Post an extreme left news aggregator. My son deliberately photo shopped the &quot;B Strong patch&quot; and Brietbart logo pin off my hat because he felt it was too far right for our family photograph.&quot;Chick Fill A&quot; a chicken specialist is faced with selling right or left wings in their wing baskets. One time the left wing basket had a right wing mixed in by accident..It was noticed and there was hell to be paid. the resturant was forced to close all day Sunday. Mean while the President &quot;an extreme right winger&quot;continues undaunted rebuilding the courts and doing the peoples business while extreme left wingers continue pecking on anything that moves. Please pass the ranch dressing .</p>
